    /* Day3 dev:
     * HI! I'm tremorlives a 16y old italian dreaming of becoming a professional game developer :D
     * Feel free to do WHATEVER you want with the project, just make sure to make it cooler!
     * 
     * TO CREATE A NEW FALLING OBJECT:
     * duplicate the missle prefab
     * tweak variables like the sprite or the velocity
     * assign a custom tag and code the HIT behaiour on the PlayerCollision script
     * then create my custom object called "WarningObject" (It's in the create menu)
     * fill in the values (sounds are not obbligatory)
     * add it to the spawner you select:
     * - DangerSpawner: if the item is spawned every x seconds
     * - RareItemSpawner: if your item has a probability of being spawned
     * 
     * TO EDIT THE GAME MANAGER:
     * the game manager has a lot of curves, each of them controls a specific value in funcion of distance or time
     * look the GameManager script for info
     * pls inspect the included curves to see examples
     *
     * Oh hey, this is me, the Day5 dev.
     * I'll just give you some advice: Make the game fun.
     * ok byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
     *
     * jk
     * Right now, I think the game just needs to be visually pleasing.
     * Some background objects would help? Maybe?
     * Anyways, looking forward to the final game!
